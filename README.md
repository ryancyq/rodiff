# rodiff

A ruby wrapper for [ODiff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff), an image comparison tool written in OCamel.


## Motivation

A strong candidate against the veteran players on the internet like [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) and [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick)

[Impressive benchmarks from ODiff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff#benchmarks)


## Getting Started

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:
```sh
bundle add rodiff
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:
```sh
gem install rodiff
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
